# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to build a reliable model that can estimate property prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.
